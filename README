This is the application firewall
Author:  John Dyer

Overview:

  This application allows you to redirect matching callers to the application, 
effectivly acting like a firewall, this host.allow.  No matching callers are 
either rejected with a fast busy, or a custom message, both of which are set 
in the config.ini file (set in static XML	file ./db/data.xml)


Setup:

	-Deploy in web accessible location, if you wish to utilize Prophecy's built 
	in webserver then deploy in the following path (OS Dependent)
	
	Windows:  C:\Program Files\Voxeo\webapps\www\
	OSX/Linux \opt\voxeo\webapps\www\
	
	Add the following application URL as your default route (Type=CCXML)
	
 	http:///127.0.0.1:9990/Caller-Firewall/ccxmlRouter.xml             

	You will need to edit the config.ini file to set this redirect route to your
	existing application URL for successful redirects
   

Adding Callers:

	Please add callers you wish to 'bless' to the data.xml file, which is located
	in the db directory.  The format is quite simple:

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
		<users>
			<record phone="4074740001">
				<name>John Dyer</name>
				<type>office</type>
			</record>
		</users>	
		
		Simply add additional nodes as needed! Thats all folks!
		
		
	

	Testing:
		You can edit the cccxmlRouter.xml file and on line 22 set test to true:
		
		<var name="diagnosticMode" expr="'false'"/>
		
		Changing this value allows you to edit line 52, or 53, to 'spoof' ANI 
		which can help during deployment.
